  title={Mitigating Oversmoothing Through Reverse Process of GNNs for Heterophilic Graphs},
  author={MoonJeong Park and Jaeseung Heo and Dongwoo Kim},
  abstract={Graph Neural Network (GNN) resembles the diffusion process, leading to the over-smoothing of learned representations when stacking many layers. Hence, the reverse process of message passing can produce the distinguishable node representations by inverting the forward message propagation. The distinguishable representations can help us to better classify neighboring nodes with different labels, such as in heterophilic graphs. In this work, we apply the design principle of the reverse process to the three variants of the GNNs. Through the experiments on heterophilic graph data, where adjacent nodes need to have different representations for successful classification, we show that the reverse process significantly improves the prediction performance in many cases. Additional analysis reveals that the reverse mechanism can mitigate the over-smoothing over hundreds of layers. Our code is available at https://github.com/ml-postech/reverse-gnn.},

  title={SpReME: Sparse Regression for Multi-Environment Dynamic Systems,},
  author={Moonjeong Park and Youngbin Choi and Dongwoo Kim},
  abstract={This paper introduces a new weakly supervised learning approach for instance segmentation using extreme points, i.e., the topmost, leftmost, bottommost, and rightmost points of an object. Although these points are readily available in the modern bounding box annotation process and offer strong clues for precise segmentation, they have received less attention in the literature. Motivated by this, our study explores extreme point supervised instance segmentation to further enhance performance at the same annotation cost with box-supervised methods. Our work considers extreme points as a part of the true instance mask and propagates them to identify potential foreground and background points, which are all together used for training a pseudo label generator. Then pseudo labels given by the generator are in turn used for supervised learning of our final model. Our model generates high-quality masks, particularly when the target object is separated into multiple parts, where previous box-supervised methods often fail. On three public benchmarks, our method significantly outperforms existing box-supervised methods, further narrowing the gap with its fully supervised counterpart.},
