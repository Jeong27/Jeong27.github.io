I am a Ph.D. student at the [POSTECH Machine Learning Lab](https://ml.postech.ac.kr/), under the guidance of Prof. [Dongwoo Kim](https://dongwookim-ml.github.io/), within the [Graduate School of Artificial Intelligence](https://ai.postech.ac.kr/) at [POSTECH](https://postech.ac.kr/eng/).

My research interest lies in various aspects of machine learning, but not limited to, Graph Neural Network and Dynamical systems.
I recently interested in interpreting deep learning network architectures and training methods through the lens of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs), and develop innovative and efficient neural network designs by integrating advanced mathematical principles with practical applications.

I'm actively seeking opportunities for meaningful collaborations and internships.
If you find my work interesting or have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out.
